  <h1>Camera App</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>The Camera app is an Android application that allows capturing and recording of videos. Additionally, users can choose a picture from the gallery and modify it using various editing features. This app is built upon the professor's, Robert Bailey starter app, which included simple photo and video captures. To enhance functionality, I integrated the image picker feature from the gallery using the <a href="https://github.com/Dhaval2404/ImagePicker">ImagePicker library</a>. Moreover, I implemented all the features required for modifying images.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Photo and Video Capture:</strong> Allows users to capture photos and record videos directly from the app.</li>
    <li><strong>Image Modification:</strong> Users can choose a picture from the gallery and apply various editing features to modify it.</li>
    <li><strong>Integration with ImagePicker:</strong> Utilizes the ImagePicker library to enable users to select images from the gallery.</li>
  </ul>
